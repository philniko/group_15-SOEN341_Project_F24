Summary:
To protect the GitHub, we made it not possible to push directly to the main branch but to create a branch then create a pull request to merge the branches. Created a branch for the readme file. Reviewed the code from the video about MongoDB, React, Express, Node so we could all better understand those languages to start the coding process. We assigned Phil, Kevin and Omar to backend and Carlo, Charles and Zach to front end. Created issues Implement backend for login register, implement team creation feature, add “How to run” section in README file, Implement frontend for login component, implement frontend for register component, implement frontend teacher dashboard, implement student dashboard, implement student and teacher models for database and implement the group model. Assigned story points for each task and set the milestone to Sunday September 29th which is the sprint 1 deadline, and all these tasks were put into iteration 2 which is due by Sunday which is the dealine for sprint 1. Assigned roles for each member of the group in the GitHub

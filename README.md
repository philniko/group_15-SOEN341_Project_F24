# group_15-SOEN341_Project_F24

## Description
**group_15-SOEN341_Project_F24 is a peer assessment system targeted towards university level team projects!** It allows students to both give and receive valuable feedback for individual contributions made in anonymous way, promoting collaboration and accountability. It is also a way
for instructors to evaluate the individual contributions of students, ensuring work was
distributed in an equitable fashion.
<br><br>

Student users are evaluated by 4 categories...
- Cooperation
- Conceptual Contribution
- Practical Contribution 
- Work Ethic
<br><br>

After every student participant has submitted their assessment for every other student in their team, they may gain access to the results of their peer-reviewed evaluation. Students may not know what individual values were given to each category; they will only have access to an average value. Instructors however will be able to see the distribution of values for every category.
